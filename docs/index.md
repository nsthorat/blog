  <p>
    I write software, tinker with music, build aquariums, live in a church, and try not to take myself too seriously.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most recently, I co-founded <a href="https://www.lilacml.com/">Lilac AI</a>, which is now <a href="https://www.databricks.com/blog/lilac-joins-databricks-simplify-unstructured-data-evaluation-generative-ai">joining Databricks</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before that, I was at Google for 10+ years where I created projects like <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">TensorFlow.js</a> and <a href="https://knowyourdata.withgoogle.com/">Know Your Data</a>.
